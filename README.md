wakaScript is made possible via Apple's Accessibility APIs and a pinch of AppleScript.

## Use
wakaScript will **not** work if the file you are editing is "Untitled", as in it is a new document and has never been saved. Be sure to save new documents and title them before writing your script.

## Install

Recomended installation will be via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). More info to come.
