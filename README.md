## Use
wakaScript will **not** work if the file you are editing is "Untitled", as in it is a new document and has never been saved. Be sure to save new documents and title them before writing your script.

## Installation

Recomended installation will be via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). More info to come.

The companion iOS Hackatime home screen widget app is available via [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Fda4449P), and the source is available at [/iOS](https://github.com/jacobprezant/wakaScript/tree/main/iOS).
